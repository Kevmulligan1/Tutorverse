        <h3>Private Tutoring</h3>
        <hr>
        <h5> Our primary business we offer is private, remote tutoring. We do all of our sessions via Zoom and have found
           a great deal of success. We employ college students looking for jobs in education and they have been able to connect
           with students on a level that traditional teachers are unable to.

        <h3>School Partnerships</h3>
        <hr>
        <h5> We have been actively seeking schools across the country to partner up with and offer our tutoring to 
           all of the students . Our main objective here at the Tutorverse is to give students that extra perspective
           that they often times need. If you would like to learn more about how to partner with us please feel free to reach out!
