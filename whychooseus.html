            <h1>Why Choose Us</h1>
            <p>What do we have to offer that you can't get anywhere else? We do something here that you do not see in 
                other tutoring companies. And that is, that we employ student tutors. In fact, all of our tutors are college students.
                At first this may sound crazy, however there is science to prove that what we are doing here is beneficial. Students are more likely
                to learn from people they see as "peers" rather than people they look at as authoritative figures. Student tutors are 
                better able to relate to the students and in this way can break through that inital barrier of connecting with the student that 
                traditional tutors or teachers oftentimes struggle with. Also, our tutoring is all online. This may seem like an obstacle at first however, it is really more of a great 
                oppurtunity. This is because now students can receive tutoring from literally anywhere, at anytime, and by any very educated tutor 
                in the country. Our tutoring has worked for hundreds of families to date and if you give us a chance I'm sure that we can satisfy
                whatever it is your student needs!

                     a great deal of success. We employ college students looking for jobs in education and they have been able to connect
                     with students on a level that traditional teachers are unable to.
