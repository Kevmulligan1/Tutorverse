            <h1>How it all started</h1>
          <p>Hi! My name is Kevin Mulligan. I am currently a college student studying mechanical engineering at Lehigh University. 
            I started this company last December and it started solely as a fully remote private tutoring service. Being a college student, I was just looking 
            for a part time job I could do with flexible hours. I had a history in tutoring leading back to high school, so I figured I'd try it out again, this time doing 
            it remote since it was becoming more and more common after the pandemic. So, I began posting about it online and immediatiely found a lot of interest! 
            After a little while I then found a few of my freinds and peers who were interested in doing this too so I created an LLC and we started tutoring together. 
            It has all been such an amazing journey! Our sole objective as a company has always been to help students who need it the most we strive to help 
            more and more families each and every day. I know first hand that school is not easy, not at any level. Ever since starting tutoring, it is the best
            feeling in the world giving another person the tools they need for success in school. And so I hope we can do that for you! Please reach out with any 
            interest or questions you may have. Thank you!
            </p>
